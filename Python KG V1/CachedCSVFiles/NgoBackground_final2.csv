From an initial team size of 3, UMMEED today is an 80+ member strong professional team.UMMEED's vision is to help children with developmental disabilities and those at risk for acquiring disabilities reach their maximum potential and be integrated in society. There are over 50 million children in India with developmental disabilities and over 650,000 in Mumbai alone. Out of these, not even a quarter have access to quality care. UMMEED addresses this mammoth issue through 4 verticals:*        Each year there are over 1,110 children and families supported at their clinic. *        UMMEED assesses and provides therapies for children with a wide range of developmental disabilities such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, Intellectual Disability, Learning Disability, Genetic Syndromes such as Down Syndrome, William Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome, Hearing Impairment. *        Over 60% of the children availing services at UMMEED's clinic are from low/mid socio-economic backgrounds. *        Ummeed also runs an Early Intervention Center (EIC), which is a mother-child program modeled on the pre-school model, where children between the ages of 2-6 years are trained on communication skills, play skills, social interaction, etc. with the objective of getting them school ready. Ummeed is one of the five centers in India approved for providing a recognized Fellowship program in Developmental Pediatrics, the IAP Fellowship in Developmental Pediatrics.

They do this through training professionals, parents, teachers, community workers and partner organizations in a range of various disciplines in the child development & disability space.Ummeed participated in a five-year four-country research project funded by the National Institutes of health, USA and in partnership with Yale University and the University of Ankara, to develop and test a tool to monitor and support Early Childhood Development specifically for use in low and middle-income countries. This tool is now used in Ummeed's community programs to monitor child development. The findings of this research have recently been published in the Lancet, one of the most prestigious peer reviewed medical journals. *        Ummeed is constantly working to better the lives of children with disabilities.

As she thought through the solution, she believed that the answer lay in a people's movement that needed to come together to provide every child in India an excellent education. In 2007, Shaheen met with Wendy Kopp, the Founder of Teach For America and was struck by the idea of leadership being at the core of the solution. In 2009, Teach For India welcomed our first cohort, the Class of 2009, to the Fellowship. The 87 ""niners"" formed the beginning of what Shaheen hoped would become a nationwide movement of diverse leaders. In 2011, their Niners graduated from the Fellowship and became the first cohort in their Alumni movement. Through their work as Alumni, the hope was that they would become lifelong leaders for equity. Their first cohort of Alumni went into teaching, teacher training, school leadership, and government policy. Today, they have 1145 Fellows working relentlessly in the short-term to change the lives of 40,075 students in their classrooms and become leaders for change themselves.

The programs are spread across different slum areas in the city. Two of their major interventions are in the field of education as well as elderly. Under education, Sarthak Prayas runs remedial education centers where students from government schools attend classes every day to improve their knowledge. The centres help students complete their homework and revise lessons of the day. They also impart life skills and teach them how to deal with real life situations. The organisation runs eight centers in Delhi/NCR with 40 students studying in each center. Since the children are from an impoverished background, the organisation also supplements their nutrition with packed food every day after the class. In addition to this, as part of recreation for the children, the centres also celebrate children's birthdays every month. During the celebrations, children cut cake and the teachers distribute gifts. Each day the students attend sessions for approximately 90 minutes. Their other program focuses on people at the other end of the age spectrum, the underprivileged elderly. The premise behind this is that the elderly have struggled all their life for food, shelter and livelihood. They have now reached an age where their bodies don't allow them to work a lot and their economic conditions do not allow their families to be able to take care of them either.Sarthak Prayas visits the slums and identifies elderly people who were unable to take care of themselves.

Maria Seva Sangha was established in 1981 to undertake educational, medical, housing and other social activities in aid of the poor and the underprivileged of all ages, irrespective of caste, creed, and community.The initial seeds of Maria Seva Sangha was planted by Ms. Ethel Brito, a prominent social worker. Back in the 1970s, Ms. Brito was strongly concerned by the poor quality of life of the weaker sections of society in Bangalore. Her dream of improving the plight of the underprivileged began to grow and in 1981, the Maria Seva Sangha was born, to cater to their needs.Some of the issues that Ms. Brito felt strongly about inlcuded:Poor, deserving students not being able to pursue higher studies due to financial constraints.Hundreds of poverty stricken children attending school on empty stomachs.Shortage of housing for battered women, widows and low income group families.Large numbers of elderly people desperately wanting care and shelter.In 1981, Ms. Brito, along with a group of like-minded, public-spirited people, set up a voluntary organization and they called it, Maria Seva Sangha. They worked together to obtain registration, tax-exemption, FCRA sanction and the like, to establish the institution's credentials in the eyes of the public. Several projects were launched to support economically deprived children, widows, families and elders, through a strong financial base slowly built up by the generosity and goodwill of donors.However, following prolonged litigation, spanning over one-and-a-half decades, related to the eviction of tenants and settlement of claims on properties bequeathed to MSS, the Sangha's resources were severely depleted. With good support from donors and the public, on closure of these issues, the Sangha has been able to embark whole-heartedly on two new projects, the Senior Citizens Home and the development of apartment buildings and residential sites for the underprivileged- Mathrudhan- at Krishnarajapuram .The Midday Meal Scheme for underpriviledged children commenced in 1987.

Against a nominal amount of Rs. 60 ($0.89) a patient receives consultation, treatment and free medicines for a week. A project started by two brothers, has now transformed to an initiative serving millions of patients per year and generating employment for many. The organization was set up following the prolonged suffering of one of its founders with cancer, since an early age. This exposed to him and his brother, the lack of quality health care facilities in India, particularly so for the rural poor. The brothers got together with like-minded people and established RHCF which provides low cost, quality health care in rural areas based on a model that is scalable, sustainable and replicable. Anant and Arun Nevatia wound up their booming construction business and started this initiative for the poor. He realised there is no end to money making and he decided to give back to society. Taking this vision forward the brothers started this initiative to provide health care to the poor. RHCF centres run six days a week throughout the year.

It seeks to dissolve the barriers that rob these children of the opportunity to realize their rights.In the 1980s, the making of Mira Nair’s ‘Salaam Bombay’ (award winning film) revealed the dark underbelly of Mumbai’s streets, where several childhoods were at stake. A combination of socio-economic exigencies, political circumstances and parents’ struggle for survival created a large population of children, living and working on the streets of India. All across the country, the street children, an invisible section of the society, continued an invisible struggle on the streets of Delhi too.In the day time, children grapple with the challenges of street life. When night falls, they curl up in crevices - at the end of the platform, under a staircase, in the subway - where the possibility of security exists. Ms Praveen Nair, Chairperson and Trustee at Salaam Baalak Trust testifies: “It took us quite a while to break the ice with the boys. Sanjoy (Roy) and myself would scout the railway platforms every day, chat with the boys, however they had been cheated time and again, and we weren’t the first to propose help. So, they would laugh off our intentions but we never gave up. Finally, when we answered their urgent call for help to care for a terribly sick boy, a friend of theirs, began the never-ending bond.”Having spent quality time with these children, the founding members of the Trust realised that while most of these children were forced into these circumstances, many of them had chosen this life. What set them apart, was their chutzpah, their spirit. Ms Nair adds: “We started with the idea of donating blankets to the children in the bitter winter cold. We started at the very place where GRP centre now stands. However, we were naive about their actual needs. The children told us that sleeping under a blanket invited sexual attentions from older children. They stuffed newspapers and wore layers of clothing (all the clothes they possessed, actually) which not only kept them warm but also kept the clothes from being stolen! That’s when we realised that these children needed a roof over their heads and safe spaces.”From three staff and 25 children on a balcony of the Ground Reserve Police at the New Delhi Railway station more than 32 years ago, we have now grown to over 250 staff, providing support services for approximately 10000 children a year in Delhi and the NCR region through our 7 shelter homes and 10 contact points.Over the years, Salaam Baalak Trust has successfully worked with over 1 lakh children; out of which significant numbers have been restored to their families. Every year almost 10-11 children across SBT pursue higher education. We have children who grew up to become lawyers, fashion designers, photographers, puppeteers and engineers.

Prerana offered its office as a shelter for children, who were mostly living on Raichur railway station.Over the next 3 to 4 years, the activities with the children expanded and recreational activities were included such as picnics, skill training programs like cycle-repair, screen printing and so on. Although the attempts to place them in jobs met limited success, the engagement with children continued. After a family adopted one child, they realized that many of these children were not abandoned by their families, but had opted to 'flee' because of certain reasons (which in most cases were not very serious) without actually thinking of the consequences.The concept of 'restoration' or 'home-placement' of children thus began to take shape. Ground research revealed that the parents are also distraught when the child leaves; and they often attempt to search the child without any leads. There was a zeal within the team members to work on this issue in a dedicated manner and a new organization was carved out of Prerana.

The Foundation also aims to encourage organ donation at the time of death. TANKER was started by Dr. Georgi Abraham along with a group of like-minded individuals. From providing financial assistance to needy patients and spreading awareness to providing subsidized and free dialysis, TANKER has taken every effort to live up to its vision. It currently provides services in the following areas:Dialysis: A person suffering from kidney failure can survive only when he/she undergoes dialysis or a kidney transplantation. Haemodialysis involves the use of an artificial kidney termed ""Dialyser"", which emulates the functions of a normal kidney. It needs to be done 2-3 times a week and is an expensive process. TANKER Foundation has made dialysis affordable for economically backward sections using their Subsidised Units. Dialysis in a private hospital costs anywhere between Rs 1500 to Rs. 2500. At TANKER, dialysis is offered either free or at a subsidised rate of Rs. 375 to patients. It costs TANKER Rs.1100 for every dialysis. The shortfall of Rs.725 is covered by donations from well wishers. Presently 377 patients benefit from this every month.Fistula- An A V fistula is essential for dialysis. This is created surgically by joining a vein to an artery in the area of the wrist. Impure blood is first drawn from the fistula on the patient's wrist, passed through the dialyser machine and clean blood is returned to the patient. A Fistula surgery costs between Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 15,000/-, which is beyond what many patients can afford. Financial Support- The Foundation helps needy patients from all over India by offering them one-time contributions ranging from Rs.1,500/- to Rs.20,000/- towards transplantation, investigation and post-transplantation medication costs. Research grants- The importance of advances in Kidney research is recognised by TANKER. Funding is provided to research projects for studies in various aspects of kidney disease. Internships and training- TANKER at its various dialysis units provides training and internship for budding nurses, lab technicians and those looking at Administrative roles. The Foundation is also a training ground for students of Social Work, Public Relations and Sociology.Organ Donation- TANKER encourages deceased-donor organ donation that can be a boon for not just kidney patients but also for others suffering from life threatening ailments. Deceased-donor organ donation is not very popular in our country and hence the recipient waiting lists are long.Deceased-donor organ donation consists of removing viable organs from brain dead donors and then transplanting them into a living patient who needs it. Soon after a patient is declared brain dead (the patient is dead but the heart maintains circulation usually with mechanical ventilation support), the organs are harvested. The harvested organs are then kept cold to delay the natural decaying process. These are then transplanted to the needy patient.TANKER under the Deceased-Donor Transplantation Programme, sponsored a meeting of surgeons and physicians in October, 2005. Their recommendation to the health Secretary resulted in the expansion of the panel of specialists who certify brain-stem death. The TANKER Trustee Doctors were part of the team that performed the first government approved multi organ deceased-donor transplant in December 1995.

bb75451d-5624-3d12-9b8f-e0874f49112a,,,"Antarang envisions a world where every young person is productively, positively and passionately engaged in a vocation of their choice.Priya Agrawal and Lopa Gandhi have worked extensively with adolescents from low income settlements. The gap between education and employment was a big one to bridge - and without employment education seemed meaningless and added to the frustration of youth from these disadvantaged communities. Youth tended to drop out and meander aimlessly at the vulnerable 16 - 18 year age group. Thus was born an intervention that looked at specific career outcomes that gave purpose and direction to their lives. Antarang started with a pilot group of 20 youth from slums across Mumbai in a 6 weekend intervention. The success of that pilot and the resultant placement of >50% of youth from that group slowly led to more groups and more partnerships.Priya Agrawal has held key leadership roles in the social sector, having headed organisations like The Akanksha Foundation and SNEHA in the past.Antarang Foundation is a registered not-for-profit organisation that works with disadvantaged young adults. Through structured interventions, they motivate young people to stay in education until they are 18, after which, they train them in employability skills and place them in careers of their choice. They do this through two career focused programmes CareerAware and CareeReady.Their CareeReady programme is a career readiness and employability skills training programme for youth in the age group of 18 - 25 years. Students undergo a well-defined regiment of development and training. The program consists of 5 key aspects spread over different sessions: Career awareness, Self-awareness, Work skills, Work ethics and Business spoken English.CareeReady groups in the communities are a mix of adolescents with different educational backgrounds - some may be school dropouts, others may be pursuing their 12th or beyond. Different techniques are used to keep the batch engaged given the inconsistent educational backgrounds. Several batches of CareerReady Programme are run simultaneously across multiple locations in Mumbai. Keeping this diversity in mind, facilitators or trainers use a 'Buddy System' which enhances learning as well as boosts confidence.Rather than a one-way dialogue, all concepts are explained with the help of role plays and various activities. Students are also encouraged to work on projects in groups. They support interactive style of learning rather than a lecture/authority style of delivery. They believe in the concept of 'Do and Learn' and therefore, promote self-learning to develop critical thinking skills and retain knowledge that leads to self-actualisation. Trainers also use audio-visual aids as and when required to introduce an element of fun!The CareerAware program""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" is at once an exciting and terrifying question for any teenager or young adult. At this stage, it is the awareness of options, the ability to make an informed choice and the process of charting out a career path that motivates adolescents and young adults to stick to education, and set career goals. In India, the Right to education ends at the age of 14, and only 1 in 2 children complete high school. The ratio of students in higher education is sadly even lower. Every school drop-out is prone to high risk behaviour, and usually end up in informal employment, characterised by low wages and no benefits.To break this cycle, Antarang introduced the CareerAware program. The program targets students who fall in the crucial 14 - 17 years age bracket. Through intensive self awareness, career awareness and career planning sessions, CareerAware encourages teenagers to stay in education until they are 18 years old. By emphasising on the number and quality of options that become available only if they stay in education, CareerAware reinforces the importance of education in young minds.",,,,,

The idea was suggested to her by one of Vathsalya's trustees as Vathasalya struggled to place differently abled kids in homes. Kutumba was started as a home for boys with MR/CP. Patients were mainly referred by Spastic Society. Until 1997-98 the boys were sent to Spastic Society for vocational training. However slowly Kutumba started accepting girls but as there was an issue housing boys and girls, they started weaning of the boys. Once the last boy had left they tied up with APD to offer safe housing for the girls attending APD vocational training courses.Kutumba was operating out of rented premises until 2006 they moved into their own premises. The 10000 sq.ft of land was donated by Mary's cousin and two corporate donors. I-flex solutions, Bangalore and Stichting Geron in the Netherlands came forward and donated 15 lacs each to fund the building of two cottages. In 2007 Goldman Sachs sponsored roofing between the 2 cottages to create a sheltered space for activities. This is when Kutumba started a preschool/daycare for kids of daily wage workers (mainly construction workers). Kutumba has a residential facility for differently abled young women. The ages of these young women range between 19 and 30. Most of the girls are orthopedically challenged. A few are with speech and hearing impairment. These girls are from rural parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh from very poor homes. All the girls attend 1-year or 2-year vocational & technical training classes at The Association of People with Disability (APD). The beneficiaries are provided food, shelter, transport free of cost. The girls stay at Kutumba for one to three years on an average. An average of 20 girls stay, although the numbers could go up to 30 or come down to 15 depending on the period of training and admission of new residents. APD also sends short-term course trainees. These girls stay here anywhere between 2 days to 3 months. Kutumba also runs a pre-school and day care (10:30 a.m. -4:00 p.m.) for young children between the ages of 2-5 years. These kids come from a nearby slum area. Most of their parents are daily wage workers or are employed as maids.

Our vision is an India where all children are treated equally, are provided a nurturing support system and have access to an education that gives them the confidence and skills to follow their dreams. Our mission is to level the playing field for children who have neither seen books nor stepped into a school. The children we work with come from extremely impoverished backgrounds and are mostly rag pickers, beggars, addicts, runaways and orphans. We currently work with over a 3,351 children.
Aasraa Trust seeks to alleviate poverty in Dehradun by providing the many disenfranchised children in the city with the opportunity to pursue an education. Our organization has crafted a cyclical approach. Our projects include outreach to bring children into basic literacy, street smart to prepare for schooling, sponsorship for education, after school tutorial support, mobile learning centers, anti- begging and vocational training, nutrition, medical, clothing and shelter.
Firstly, we start by reaching out to children in the slums through our outreach team. Then the children are initiated into the first step of our Street Smart education project where we conduct classes within the neighborhood to foster trust and basic education, committed students move to the next step of the program at a facility that provides a more structured classroom environment where the children learn basic Hindi, English, and Mathematics.
Once they have achieved an elementary level education, we help to mainstream these children into formal schools by providing scholarships that pay their school fees and living expenses.
Children who have entered the formal schooling, then become a part of our other project, ‚Wings of Doon‚ which is an after-school program that promotes character building and academic achievement. The children who attend this program also take advantage of tutorials in a wide range of subjects. These complementary projects work to provide children access to schooling and the tools and support to help them thrive academically.
We launched an Anti-Begging Campaign for child beggars in January 2014 in association with the Dehradun District Administration. The goal of the campaign is to discourage child beggary, provide the child beggars with basic literacy, lessons in hygiene, grooming, art therapy, nutrition and medical care. As a part of this project, young adults are provided with vocational training in sewing and block printing as well.
Children who for various reasons are unable to gain entrance into mainstream schools are provided the option of NIOS. We are a study and exam center from the National Institute of Open Schooling for its ‚Open Basic Education Program. We also provide vocational training for young adults to enable them to earn a respectable livelihood in the future.
Working children who do not attend school due to their socio-economic condition are provided basic literacy through our Mobile Learning Centers that are classrooms on wheels teaching through high tech e-learning methods. This is a fun interactive way of learning that keeps the children's interest alive and helps in regularizing them in the classroom setup.
For boys and girls who come from a home environment that is not conducive to their educational pursuit, Aasraa also provides shelter homes.
In addition to this we provide nutritional support and a medical aid that covers children throughout all our projects.",,"In the last 10 years, we have grown from 35 children under the Bindal Bridge to over a 3,351 children across 39 centres in Dehradun.
 649 children have been initiated into basic literacy through the Street Smart program.
The after school support program i.e. Wings of Doon, assists 1,895 children, which include mainstreamed Aasraa
children and students from various Government Schools.
In January 2019, we signed another MOU with the Uttarakhand Education Department for School Quality Enhancement Program (SQEP) allowing us to work with and improve the quality of education in 6 Government Schools in Dehradun. 1021 children have been mainstreamed into local schools; government and private.
Aasraa is accredited by The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) as a study and exam
centre. We are also an accredited Vocational Training Centre by the NIOS; 2 Vocational Training Centres established; 70 youth benefit from these projects.

Aastha Foundation Aurangabad is registered under Bombay public Trust Act and Societies Act and is established in 2008 by a group of young, dynamic, socially aware people with a dream of making positive changes in various areas of our Society.
A detailed study in this area revealed that, there is a need of a centre which will provide a much needed attention, Comfort and care, love, dignity and respect to the Senior Citizens. In today‚Äôs fast paced life where everybody is focused on wining the rat race, we usually tend to over-look our final destination. What really matters is how we spend this golden years of our lives when all our hardship and effort pay off. This is the time when one really looks forward for a life of dignity, safety and care, but life doesn‚Äôt always seem to work on our plans. There are cases where one has a very few options to choose from. There people who have no company of the loved ones who took great care of them all their lives. Some people have only daughters who are now married happily and would not want to disturb them. Some might have sons who are settled in abroad or sometimes there are some personal family issues which don‚Äôt allow them to stay with their family.
And thus, emerged the idea of ‚ÄòBasant Prabha-Visawa‚Äô and it proposes to establish a residential housing and assisted living for the Senior Citizens. This will be constructed as ‚Äò Basant Prabha-Visawa‚Äô on a 3-acre land and will provide twin sharing room with sanitation facilities along with lawn and garden, dining hall and kitchen, meditation room and physiotherapy, counseling and cultural events.
‚ÄòAastha‚Äô believes that ‚ÄòAgeing with Dignity‚Äô is possible.

In his such an eclipsed & helpless condition, mental anguish & bitter experience when he did not find any way out to help and stand by them and was groping about in the dark – the almighty God taught him many lessons about these helpless lives and devastated society and He by His words and speeches penetrated into his heart and life ‘Caring for orphans, widows and who need help, and keeping yourself free from the world’s evil influence’ (James-1: 27). Upon solemn and sturdy foundation of these instructions, ASS gets established in the month of April, 1995 with manifold oppositions, hurdles and risks.

The approach is found to be more cost-effective and uptake of new practices by viewers is higher compared to traditional extension services.

Each week, smallholder farmers in India spend as much as a full day selling their produce at the nearest market, incurring especially high opportunity and transport costs when their production volumes are low. To reduce those costs, Digital Green created Loop, a mobile app that enables farmers to more efficiently access markets by helping them aggregate their perishable produce.

United Nations recognises the deprivation of these resources to be a violation of fundamental human rights. It is not just the responsibility of the government to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals or groups.

Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuddashiya Samajik Vikas Sewa Sanstha is a unique NGO established in Taluka Shrigonda of Ahmednagar district (Maharashtra state). We have come a long way since 2008 when we started education programmes for children of neglected and deprived sections of the society.   We believe in the philosophy that ‘Every child should have the right to a life free from inequality, cruelty and discrimination’.
Our programmes are primarily for children affected by poverty including the tribal communities of Phasay Pardhi and Dombari.  We help to provide education for underprivileged children. We cater for more than 500 beneficiaries.
INITIATIVES
Presently, we have 6 projects all over Taluka Shrigonda dedicated to our mission. Our initiatives are focussed on core dimensions of education and awareness that directly address specific needs of our beneficiaries on their journey to self-empowerment.
A.	Education
Students Aid Committee (Vidyarthi Sahayyak Samiti), Sadhana Bal Bhavan, Aarambh Bal Vidya Niketan, Freedom Fighter Ramanlal Mehta Library and Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalaam Study Center.
?	Students Aid Committee (Vidyarthi Sahayyak Samiti)
The Phase Paradhi community is an ancient tribe of India. They used to live in remote and inaccessible jungles and were very primitive in their lifestyle. They used to hunt in the jungles for their food. But when the British rulers implemented a ban on hunting in the jungles, this tribe was unable to integrate with the rural population. As a result they resorted to criminal activities to feed their families. For generations, they have been involved in criminal activities and never went to any school. At times, they are unfairly blamed for crimes they have not committed.  Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha has taken up the noble cause of uplifting this community. We have taken the responsibility of educating the children and stop the vicious circle of crime and give them a chance in their life. We provide hostel facility, admission to local school, regular and nutritious meals, tuitions and most importantly inculcate values in the children. Along with academics, we teach the children to share and care for each other. We install discipline and the importance of honesty and hard work. It is a fact - if  Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha's intervention hadn't been, these children too would have been labeled as criminals. We are proud to say that Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa is guiding the children of the Phasay Pardhi community towards a bright future by educating them and at the same time reducing the crime rate of our country.
?	Sadhana Bal Bhavan 
Taluka Shrigonda is a city and Sasane Nagar a slum which houses over 1,500 residents a part of Shrigonda.The women of these slums engage in occupations such as labourers on farm or domestic work. They are illiterate labourers and are unable to guide their children with their studies. Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuddashiya Samajik Vikas Sewa Sanstha started the Sadhana Bal Bhavan project to help the children of these slums with their studies and to mould these children into respectable citizens. Free tuitions are given to these children and workshops on health and hygiene, de-addiction, communal unity, prevention of underage marriages, dowry, etc are conducted by various experts to bring about a positive change in the society. Thus Sadhana Bal Bhavan is a movement towards profoundness and nation building. Currently 80 kids are marching towards a bright future at Sadhana Bal Bhavan.
?	Aarambh Bal Vidya Niketan
This is a unique project where youth of a village named Kashti are engrossed in nation building by educating the children of the poor, neglected sections and the Dombari community while building their own future at the same time. They are doing this out of a sense of patriotism and the urge to share their knowledge with the needy, poor and deprived section of our society. If these underprivileged children are not educated today, then they will be exploited as child labourers, beggars or resort to crime for their livelihood, thus proving to be a menace to society. The need is to educate these children and change their mindset and guide them towards a bright future. This positive change is being brought about through the medium of Aarambh Bal Bhavan in the colony of the Dombari community of the Kashti village. This colony houses about 450 families living in very poor conditions. This underdeveloped tribal community lives a nomadic life, performing their traditional art and moves around from village to village. The youth of the Kashti village are performing the Herculean task of changing the destiny of 480 children living in such dire conditions.
?	Freedom Fighter Ramanlal Mehta Library
Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuddashiya Samajik Vikas Sewa Sanstha provides library service to needy students and other citizens of Taluka Shrigonda. The library also serves as a centre of study for various competitive exams viz. MPSC, UPSC, IPS etc. The youth of Taluka Shrigonda are inclined to applying for government jobs. The team of Mahamanav Baba Amte Sanstha started the Freedom Fighter Ramanlal Mehta Library to fulfill this need and help the youth to get good government jobs. The library has over 3500 books and is visited by 125 students yearly. Workshops are also conducted by experts to guide and prepare the youth for various competitive exams.
?	Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalaam Study Center
There was a need in Shrigonda for a center with an environment conducive for knowledge gaining where students could come to study and prepare for various competitive exams as well as overall personality development. The Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalaam Study Center was thus inaugurated at Shrigonda by Hon. Anna Hazare and Dr. Ravindra Kolhe on 26th Dec 2015 on the occasion of the birth anniversary of internationally renowned social activist Baba Amte. Currently 52 students visit the center every day to study.
B.	Awareness
?	Mahamanav Baba Amte awareness lecture series.
Inspired by internationally renowned social activist Baba Amte, his wife Reverend Sadhnatai Amte, Tribune Annasaheb Hazare and the Snehalaya family, Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuddashiya Samajik Vikas Sewa Sanstha organizes lecture series on the occasion of the death anniversary of Baba Amte and the birth anniversary of Saint Gadge Maharaj. Prominent speakers and leaders are invited to create awareness amongst the masses about various social issues. The NGO feels that the youth today needs to be guided by inspiring thoughts along with academics in order to broaden their horizons. Hence the lecture series! Thousands of youth from many rural areas are influenced by this initiative of the NGO towards a better future.

Over the years we have grown in terms of scale as well as scope while retaining our core values and high commitment level. However, we are aware that fulfilling our mission requires us to do lot more and we are getting ready to transform Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha from an organisation to an Institution that will outlive it’s founders and contribute to emerging Social Welfare challenges. We therefore seek support and guidance from a much broader network of partners for the journey ahead.
Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha has been instrumental in social welfare of the children of the tribal communities of Phasay Pardhi and Dombari since last 9 years and will continue this work tirelessly and include many more under privileged students.
The past beneficiaries of Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha have been deeply influenced by our philosophy. Our NGO's past students have continued their association and taken the responsibility of the weaker students.
Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha is seeking support for volunteers, technical guidance, sharing of ideas and financial assistance for its projects.
About our Founder
Shri Anant Zende founded Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuuddeshiy Samajik Vikas Seva Sanstha as he was driven by an extraordinary dream that every child is entitled to good food, shelter, clothing and education. All through the early, difficult years, it was his passion and conviction that drove our NGO. He was strongly convinced that each of us can, in our own small way, be agents of change, and when enough of us are involved in this process, the impact is a long lasting change and that too for the better. All he asks of people is that they help our NGO by doing what they are good at.
With inspiration from leaders like Baba Amte, Sadhnatai Amte and Dr. Girish Kulkarni of Snehalaya, he started the first project of our NGO Vidhyarthi Sahhayak Samiti (Students Aid Council) at Shrigonda in Ahmednagar district was established on July 23rd, 2008. He works in a rural school during the day and devotes all his spare time to our NGO.",,"Impact:-

2)	We can provide best facilities to the students taking shelter here.
3)	The number of volunteers and staff working here will also increase. We can also invite experts from various fields to guide our beneficiaries for carrier development.As there will be separate sections for children of various age groups, their mental & physical growth will be up to the mark. At present this growth cannot always be achieved.
4)	The professional competence & quality of work done here will also increase. This will result in a long term benefit for the organization.

This is a burning systemic issue which gave rise to the MAYA Health Project.
About MAYAHealth
The whole premise of the MAYA Health Initiative is to drive preventive and promotive health practices in the rural and semi urban communities; by creating a new channel of dedicated, trained, technology enabled healthcare micro entrepreneurs who will act as the last mile connect between the healthcare ecosystem and the community in rural/semi-urban India.
MAYA Health Mission: ‚ÄúTo build a sustainable health ecosystem of caregivers who focus on providing preventive- promotional health care services and access to primary healthcare that is affordable to the community.‚Äù
We are empowering local women into health networks enabled with technology to promote health ownership and education. We call these women Health Navigators (HNs). They are inherently a network of caregivers who are delivering quality healthcare to the doorsteps of people. They are creating an environment where communities can make informed health decisions and have access to affordable quality primary healthcare.
Key Objectives:
1. Develop health knowledge of the individual and community to take control of their health, access health services and actively participate in building healthy environments.
2. To train and empower local Health Navigators to deliver high quality, affordable and easily accessible preventive healthcare services to the community. Thereby acting as a last mile connect to healthcare.
3. Develop a sustainable ecosystem and linkages to support Health Navigators and address health needs of the community.
4. Develop a model that can be sustainably scaled up using technology and create an impact on health in India.
Why is this important: We strongly believe that ‚ÄúWithout health there is no escape from poverty!‚Äù, and with our project we envision to support communities to move from a reactive mind-set to that of a proactive one towards health. This makes it possible for individual ownership of health becoming a reality. We are empowering women and mobilizing partnerships with organizations that can further support this initiative in order to reach 3 million people in the next 5 years. Each Health Navigator trained is a golden resource as a healthcare provider in her community and reaches out to over 2000 people. She acts as a last mile connect and provides linkages to critical health ecosystems in her community.
Hence long term engagements on developing the model and scaling up the project could accelerate impact to larger groups of marginalized communities.",,"1. Successfully have on board 30 Health Navigators as a part of our pilot completion stage.

We strive to create an enabling environment through various activities for children,to facilitate expression of their thoughts,ideas and creativity freely. Through these activities the children are able to express themselves in order to understand the meaning of ‘ ‘childhood’ and that every child has a right to be a child and that every child has the right to ask for their rights responsibily. 
This is especially true of underpreviledged children. In the long run it helps bring out their apptitude . understanding of the need for child rights and therefore empowers them to find ways of moving forward given the environment they live in and the lack of amenities they have no access to.

Vocational Skill Development:- High rate of growth of urban population and consequent increase in population residing in slums has today lead to over-straining of infrastructure and deterioration in a chance for employment and wide inequalities in accessing services. Such hostile circumstances coupled with the lack of social network and fall back options, arguably leads the inhabitant population to the ‚Äúsevere poverty trap‚Äù.

This further contributes to gender equality where women equally stands by her family just as a male member and becomes much more confident and motivated.

Beginning 2007, our designated year for Child Education, Development and Empowerment (CEDE) and seeing the consequent need for sustained intervention; we decided to concentrate our efforts towards education of underprivileged children. 
With a vision to spawn a wave of transformation, having received an overwhelming response to our first Development Centre (DC) and its subsequent success inspired us to broaden our approach and outreach to formulate a whole new module that would target younger children.

Follow ups are of two kinds, namely, telephonic follow ups and physical visits to the homes of restored children. Telephonic follow ups are done for every child. The first call is made one month after restoration. The second and third call follows after 3 months and 6 months of the first call, respectively. This year telephonic calls were made to 6000 children restored from shelter, camps and Govt. Homes.SATHI was able to contact 67% of children and the remaining 33% could not be contacted. 
14.Physical follow ups of around 380 children across 6 locations in Berhampur, Kanpur, Kolkata, Mughalsarai, Patna and Visakhapatnam was done. During physical follow ups, SATHI learnt that 2% of the restored children have migrated to other places.SATHI is happy to know that 96% of the remaining children continue to stay or be in touch with their families. Of these, 97% stay at home while 3% stay away but are very much in touch with their families.Among those in touch with families, 59% of children are now staying at home studying and 25% are working either nearby or away from home. 16% are idle at home.
15.A study on status of children reunited with their families in 2005-06 was conducted in 2016-17, 10 years since their home repatriation. The purpose was to know how responsible the children had become towards themselves, their family and society. We intended to understand the long term impact of ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö‚â§rescuing children from platforms‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬• and ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö‚â§reuniting them with their families‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•. We took 144 cases all from Bangalore and Wadi in Karnataka, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.120 addresses could be located. 15 families had moved out and were not traceable. In the end, we could meet 105 families. Among these 105, 2 children had run away, and unfortunately another 6 are no more.Thus, we could meet 95 children.One of the 95 is physically challenged and is not working. Another is in jail for a crime. It was satisfying to see the children fulfill their responsibilities.
16.Identification of Vulnerable and Needy children in Villages of India ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬® Integrated Child Protection Scheme ensures to provide preventive, statutory, care and rehabilitation services to vulnerable children including children from potentially vulnerable families and families at risk. This year SATHI conducted a survey on identifying needy and vulnerable children in villages of Varanasi and Visakhapatnam. This survey was to find out the number of such children, the kind of help they require and most importantly in linking these children to ICPS scheme. One district each from Varanasi and Visakhapatnam were included in the study. 9 staff and 10 volunteers surveyed 123 villages in 13 days.176 children from 73 villages of Varanasi and 172 children from 50 villages of Visakhapatnam were identified as needy and vulnerable.This is a unique survey of voluntarily screening villages in identifying vulnerable and needy children. The number of children in need in just few villages tells us about the many more needy children in villages of different states across India. A consolidated report of both the studies has been submitted to respective DCPU, CWCs and DWCD.
17.In 2016-17, ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö‚â§Goonjan android app‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬• has been developed to enable real-time feeding of profile of children at the railway platforms.SATHI‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•s data management systems have evolved and become robust over a period of time, with the level of data captured per child being exhaustive. This year, we proposed that the system can be adopted and used by multiple organizations working in the same field. Towards this, SATHI has demonstrated the entire process and its benefits to different organizations including funding agencies and consulting organizations including Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives, Dalberg, Mumbai and IFMR (Institute of Financial management & Resource, Chennai). We are also exploring if the process and model can be adopted or integrated with Childline‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•s data capture process, especially in locations where Railway Childline has been started. 
18.SATHI has started entering details of found children in the KhoyaPaya portal provided by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Govt. of India. In 2016-2017, 1245 entries were made by SATHI on the portal.",,,

As part of the celebrations of the birth centenary of Sister Nivedita, they arranged few lectures and programs in the college.

Inspired by him, Smt. Ushaben and Shree. Gulabbhai opened a small K.G. school in the name of Sister Nivedita in 1968 and thus Sister Nivedita Educational Complex (SNEC) came into existence.
The aim of SNEC is to provide quality education to all. We aim to challenge the conventional ""teacher-to-student"" or one-way method of teaching, giving way to active involvement of the students in the learning process through group workshops, activities and interactive sessions. Our effort is directed to encourage self-learning, while developing the mind, body and spirit.
After one year of activities of Sister Nivedita Educational Complex, parents and guardians of the students approached and persuaded us to start primary school and a year later to start High School and Higher Secondary School.

We are an India based charity with our footprint in 8 Indian states and having served over 15,000 beneficiaries through our work.
At present, we work on promotion of Climate Smart Crops and Agriculture, directly with the farmers and also by facilitating market linkages. We primarily do this work in Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh, which is the second most drought-prone region in the country. The main thrust of our work is encouraging more farmers to move to grow millets, which are climate-smart and nutrition-smart crops. They take very less water to grow, thrive in poor, saline soils and ensure a safe and reliable harvest for farmers despite poor rainfall. Apart from this we also link them to markets for their produce.
We would further like to expand this work and support farmers through a more structured intervention focusing on technical know-how, organic certifications, processing, value addition and awareness generation on the health benefits of these foods. This has the potential to provide further livelihood options in an area which suffers from a multitude of problems including limited livelihood options, due to adverse climatic conditions.
An intervention designed to promote and revive these crops in the rural areas would also fit extremely well with the vision of the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals, specifically, SDG 2: End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture, and SDG 13 Climate Action
We are very enthusiastic about this project and feel that it has the potential to have a lasting impact, not just on the lives of the farmers but also the environment.

UTMT targets rural poverty in underdeveloped, tribal districts of Maharashtra, Gujarat and M.P. through Bees for Poverty Reduction strategy. This unique and innovative framework impacts small farmers through livelihood diversification with increased agricultural productivity due to low cost beekeeping. This increases employment and incomes for small and marginal farmers.
Declining agricultural growth rates over the last two decades, in addition to a slower employment growth rate, necessitate an urgent need to diversify rural livelihoods and improve incomes of the rural poor. Given that the benefit of beekeeping is 40 times more than the value of honey and beeswax, the first National Commission on Agriculture (1976) in India had recommended beekeeping purely as an agricultural input and put forth a plan for apiculture until 2000. However, subsequent agricultural policy unfortunately did not give beekeeping the importance it deserves.
Our Bees for Poverty Reduction (BPR) Programme concentrates on:
‚Ä¢ Increase in agricultural yields of small and marginal farmers by 40-50% through Bee-pollination.
‚Ä¢ Training at the village level over a 12 month period of hand holding and support so that the training incorporates local flora, seasonal management which is crucial for successful beekeeping.
‚Ä¢ Creating a cadre of local Master Trainers who will facilitate scaling up the model locally.
‚Ä¢ Creating long term, sustainable market linkages for the farmer for the honey and beeswax produced.
Achievements:
‚Ä¢ Since 2009, 2500 farmers have benefited from BPR, primarily through increased agricultural yields.
‚Ä¢ A 2011 rapid impact survey conducted by UTMT in Gujarat found that A. Cerana beekeepers experienced 30% to 160% higher agricultural yields (depending on crop) compared to similar farmers without bee-boxes.
‚Ä¢ A small-scale study conducted by Dalberg Associates found that BPR beekeepers increased annual household savings, invested in assets, and spent more on health and education after training.
‚Ä¢ UTMT was among the top three emerging innovations in the Agriculture and Rural Innovations Category at the 2009 Sankalp awards, an all India competition organised by Intellecap and Rockefeller Foundation that recognises innovative work.
‚Ä¢ The following year, UTMT was highlighted as one of ‚Äú25 Good Businesses‚Äù in the Outlook Business Independence Day Special Issue.
‚Ä¢ In 2011 UTMT was recognised as one of the top five ‚ÄúSocial Innovations‚Äù in the CNBC TV 18 Samsung Innovation Quotient.
‚Ä¢ The BPR model was featured as a low cost external input for sustainable agriculture in the well known LEISA magazine‚Äôs March 2012 issue. The LEISA article highlighted UTMT‚Äôs research findings which demonstrated the critical link between bees and agricultural productivity.
‚Ä¢ UTMT‚Äôs work has also been profiled in several widely read Indian publications, including Economic Times, Indian Express, Hindustan Times and Express India.

How could a few individuals with only some dreams and desire bring a change? But, if the dreams are powerful and desires are strong, the rest comes by. Its founder Jaimala  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sZApxZ_4CA) decided to give shape of her dreams of changing lives of a few street children and other disadvantaged children by registering the organization namely Vatsalya under Society Registration Act 1958 of Rajasthan in 1995. Here the idea was conceived by her of an abode, exclusively for these kids where they could feel belonged, cared and wanted. As the name indicates, the whole concept of the organization revolves around it. Vatsalya is a Sanskrit word meaning, a motherly tender and caring love for child and she believes that it exists everywhere.  She has transformed thousands of lives by her dedicated effort and leading the team of Vatsalya upfront. Vatsalya has become great place of local action by global community and nicely balanced with protecting children by nature friendly interventions.

A deeper understanding of rural problems also revealed that education cannot be viewed in isolation and must complement interventions that address issues of poverty and healthcare. Subsequent interventions were designed to establish better health infrastructure, improve access to healthcare services and empower villagers through vocational training programs and sustainable livelihood models. 
In the last decade since its inception, AIM for Seva has delivered steady and spectacular growth:129 projects in 216 months or nearly a project for every two months of the year and from 1 state of operation to 16 states, all through donations. The impact is far reaching: 2267 villages and 20 million people, touched by this novel experiment in innovative education. In qualitative terms, school drop-out rate reduced by 90%, a 95% pass rate in the board examinations and many school toppers, since the first batch of students appeared for their board exams and 80% undertook higher education or secured employment. The success stories of our alumni stands as a testimony.

A challenging goal, but one that has to be realized so that every socially and educationally disadvantaged child can realize their dream of a prosperous future.",,"1. 97 Chatralayams (Free Student Hostels), catering to 3800 children across 16 states of India.

Neither parents nor schools understood that these children were in fact autistic, and that children with autism respond best to specific intervention techniques. Schools and parents alike were helpless to provide adequate services to their children with autism.
In 1991, AFA began as a parent support group, with a focus on raising awareness about autism in India through smaller-scale project. In 1994 AFA began providing counselling services, specialised education and training for parents and professionals. March 1994 saw the start of ‚ÄòOpen Door,‚Äô the first specialised school for children with autism in South Asia. With the overwhelming response to these initiatives, the decision was taken to formally register Action for Autism in 1994. Recognising the lack of trained professionals to teach children with autism and to cater to the increasing demand for its services, AFA initiated Teacher Training Programmes.
Working within the framework of a rights based approach, AFA gradually extended its activities to include parent empowerment and advocacy activities to promote legislative action to guarantee services and rights of persons with autism.

Volunteers commit a year and spend between 2 to 10 hours every week mentoring, teaching and interacting with children in order to ensure that they get the support and care they need during childhood.
Through our core programmes, Ed Support, Foundational Programme, Dream Camps, Transition Readiness & Aftercare, Make a Difference creates a support system and an emotional safe space for children in shelters by ensuring every child has at least 3 adults who care for them, understand them and who they can reach out to when they feel overwhelmed. Children have access to trained mentors for a minimum of 2 hours a week from the age of 10 to 18, with a lighter touch approach upto 28 once they leave the shelter home. The programmes include career awareness activities, helping them identify their career path and supporting their transition to further education with both placements support and funding when required depending on their age and need. The Organisation also works closely with the shelter they are living in to ensure their basic needs are taken care of, interact with their teachers to understand their developmental needs, and engage with their guardians to build support for their choices and progression post-shelter. By the time the child comes out of the shelter home they already have strong relationships and bonds with at least 10 mentors who become their community when they need them the most.",,"The Organisation has mobilised 21,500 young leaders to volunteer with children since 2006.
